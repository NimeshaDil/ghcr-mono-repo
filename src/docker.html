            <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
            <p>Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications within containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This means that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.</p>

            <h2>Why Use Docker?</h2>
            <p>Docker simplifies the process of managing application processes in containers. Containers are lightweight, especially compared to virtual machines, and allow you to quickly start up an app in a consistent environment, regardless of where the application is running. This helps in ensuring that developers, QA, and production environments are as similar as possible, thereby reducing bugs and increasing productivity.</p>

            <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Docker ensures consistency across multiple development, release cycles, standardizing your environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Containers can be launched quickly, making it easier to rapidly deploy and scale applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> Docker requires fewer resources than traditional virtual machines because applications share the same OS kernel.</li>
            </ul>
