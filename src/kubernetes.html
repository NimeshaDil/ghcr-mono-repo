            <h2>What is Kubernetes?</h2>
            <p>Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes abstracts underlying infrastructure and provides a consistent interface for deploying and managing applications across diverse environments, including on-premises data centers, public clouds, and hybrid clouds.</p>

            <h2>Why Use Kubernetes?</h2>
            <p>Kubernetes simplifies container management by automating many tasks involved in deploying, scaling, and maintaining applications. It offers features such as automatic scaling, self-healing, rolling updates, and service discovery, enabling developers and operations teams to focus more on building and delivering applications rather than managing infrastructure.</p>
